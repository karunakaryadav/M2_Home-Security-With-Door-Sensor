__DESCREPTION__:
Here is a Project developed as mini project in embedded c as Home Security With Door Sensor.
Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system In this mini project.
you can get status of our Home Door which is closed or open.
If the Led connected to atmega port is high means if Led is Flashing then you can get the idea about status of Door i.e our door is open .
similarly, If the Led connected to atmega controller port is low means Led is not Flashing then you can get that the Door is Closed.
this is all becoz of I have made a system that if Door is closed then there will be no supply to the Led so Led will not glow .
similarly for open of door there will be supply of 5V that i have made so that Led will glow there so this is how you can get status of your Home Door with this Embedded project

**What**:
 Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system: they let you know about the Door which is open or closed
 **Why**:
 In order to get door status that if door is open then we can assume that someone is entering or going out
 **when**
   Anytime we can use this sensors as this are automatic door sensors which are connected to door to get the status of door
   **Who**
   All the peoples those who want to keep their Home secure With this Door Sensors which are easy to Install
   **How**:
   One piece attaches on the door frame, and the other attaches parallel to the first piece on the door itself
  these two parts creats close circuit when door is close and when door is open it will switch circuit
